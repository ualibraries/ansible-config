# ualibraries/ansible-config

This is a neutral place to jot down any major changes that should be
featured into our Ansible setup as we move towards a stable
configurtion management service:

*   We should create a "GLOSSARY.md" document at the root of the
    repository, so that we can clearly define common vocabulary like
    "inventory", "support", "service tag", "environment tag",
    etc. _(mgsimpson, 7/28/2018)_

*   We need to flip ansible-admin's deploy key in the Github repo
    from read/write to read-only. _(mgsimpson, 7/28/2018)_

*   _More things here..._

Please try to follow the format of the existing entries when adding
new ones.
