# Notes on the content of this directory.

The documents herein are preserved mostly for historical information,
and include detailed narrative scripts for how the original "ansible1"
and "openaz-tmpl" virtual machines were built manually in vSphere by
Mike Simpson in July 2018. There's also some very short notes about a
putative "rundeck1" support virtual host that was never really
completed.

Finally, there is an XMind-format mind map document that was used by
Mike Simpson to structure a brown bag discussion on Ansible concepts
and implementation for Platform Engineering and other staff, also in
July 2018.
