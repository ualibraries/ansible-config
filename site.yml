# file: site.yml

# 
# Top-level configuration file for all Ansible-managed inventory and services.
#
# The directory and file structures in this repository are based on:
# 
#     http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html
#
# Basically:
#
#     *   Each Ansible-managed service has its own service-level playbook,
#         "site_[service].yml". The main "site.yml" file 
#         just imports all of the individual service playbooks.
#
#     *   Ansible-managed service nodes are listed in the inventory files,
#         "_[type]", and grouped by service. Currently-defined inventory types
#         are "testing", "staging", "production", and "support".
#
# This structure allows you to invoke playbooks based on service and type,
# e.g.:
#
#     $ ansible-playbook -i _testing -l openaz site.yml
#
# The above command would invoke the Open Arizona service configuration
# against the testing nodes participating in the Open Arizona service.
